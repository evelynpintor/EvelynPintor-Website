        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Sociology/Administrative Studies ðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, Iâ€™m Evelyn Pintor and a first year student at the University of California, Riverside (UCR). Cashier with almost two years of experience, opener and closer, working towards my BA, majoring in Sociology/Administrative Studies and hoping to minor in Law and Society, and hoping to also get my Masters after my BA. I just graduated High School and Moreno Valley College as Class of 2023, at the age of 18 I have my high school diploma and three associate degrees. I am also bilingual, English and Spanish with Spanish being my foreign language and I absolutely love being able to speak more than one language because I am able to help out others, but it also gives me multiple opportunities for the real world. Everyone struggles with something but those struggles help us become a better version of ourselves to be able to spread it to others so theyâ€™ll know that theyâ€™re not alone.<br><br>

        I worked at Del Taco during October 2021 up till May 2023, I first started working in the afternoon/night, however, later on when I knew more would open weekends, 6am to 2pm. However, since I was a high school student and was taking college courses I did not have many days scheduled, yet, made that up by working during breaks and holidays. At first, it was not easy considering I wanted the holidays to be with my family, but being able to give presents to my family for Christmas for the first time with the money I earned was what kept me going. After everything my parents and siblings have done for me, I felt it was time to give back. As of right now, I am not working, my parents have rather have me focus on school than stress myself over classes, homework, and on top of that having to work. Overall, I am looking for a place to work because being a college student is not cheap, I at least just want to work to get my textbooks for however many classes I take.<br><br>

        When it comes to work I am committed, patient, organized, communicative, and work hard. Being an individual who does not feel very comfortable talking with others I will always make an effort to work with others, sharing opinions, and agreeing or disagreeing with others respectfully, it's important for me that everyone is supported no matter what and feeling comfortable with one another. Working in an environment where everyone gets along is an important factor considering I donâ€™t want myself or anyone else to have a bad experience of being belittled and having being spread around the workforce especially if itâ€™s a private matter. An environment that feels like a family. Organizational skills allow me to use resources efficiently and effectively. Being organized helps me manage my time, energy and workspace well and I can accomplish all my assigned tasks successfully. Organizational skills help me meet deadlines, pay attention to what's important about the work I do, stay focused and help others do their job well.
